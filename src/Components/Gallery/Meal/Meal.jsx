            Porcelain has a fascinating history that dates back over a thousand
            years, originating in China during the Tang Dynasty (618â€“907 AD).
            The Chinese were the first to develop the techniques for producing
            porcelain, which is a type of ceramic made from a mixture of kaolin
            clay and other minerals, fired at very high temperatures. This
            process results in a material that is both translucent and highly
            durable, setting porcelain apart from other ceramics.
